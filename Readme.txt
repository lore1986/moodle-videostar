Hello

this is a Moodle Block that allows to create navigations links on a embedded video in a Moodle Page.

Add an #id to your html <iframe> element.
Assign the same id in the configuration of the instance of your block.
Add some text for every navigation step of your video.

Now only for youtube videos.
Soon more.


Hope this helps you. 
Have fun and share
